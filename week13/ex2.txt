The goal of DEADLOCK AVOIDANCE is preventing deadlocks from hapenning beforehand.
That is achieved by preventing one of the four deadlock conditions. 
That method requires a lot of information about every process what makes it complex as future resource requirements must be known in advance.
But it can gurantee that next step taken will not lead to a deadlock.

DEADLOCK PREVENTION is the technique aimed to design the system in such a way so that deadlocks can never occur.
Such algorithms may have better perfomance that avoidance in some cases.

DEADLOCK prevention method deals with deadlocks only when they're occured. So forthe system that can effectively manipulate resources 'on the go' that tecnhique would be effective.
This method is also faster, as it doesn't require any additional computations to avoid deadlocks.
